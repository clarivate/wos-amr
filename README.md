# Web of Science Links Article Match Retrieval Service (AMR)

This client allows users to send batch requests to [AMR](http://help.incites.clarivate.com/LAMRService/WebServicesOverviewGroup/overview.html) to match local metadata to the Web of Science and retrieve details about individual documents from the Web of Science.

For more information about web services for the Web of Science, please review this [data integration](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/xml-and-apis/) website.

## Getting started

### Requirements
* Python 3
* Access to the [AMR](http://help.incites.clarivate.com/LAMRService/WebServicesOverviewGroup/overview.html) service

### Install

* Download or clone this repository by clicking on the "Clone or download" button in the top right corner
* Set two environment variables with your AMR credentials. Note, your AMR username and password is NOT the same
* as your credentials for the Web of Science.
 * WOS_USER
 * WOS_PASSWORD

#### Setting environment variables

On a Mac or Linux system:

~~~
$ export WOS_USER="myuser"
$ export WOS_PASSWORD="mypassword"
~~~

On Windows, open a command window:

~~~
set WOS_USER="myuser"
set WOS_PASSWORD="mypassword"
~~~

#### Running a script

Run the script with the incoming csv data as the first parameter and output file as the second parameter. For example:

~~~
$ python3 lookup_ids.py myfile.csv output.csv
~~~

#### A note on throttling

AMR limits the number of records you can request per minute. The example scripts in this repository include logic to respect that limit. You may have to adjust the THROTTLE_CAP value in client.py if you continue to receive throttling errors. 

#### Disclaimer

These scripts are provided to allow Web of Science users to perform common operations with the AMR web service. The scripts and uses cases may change over time. No direct support is provided. Please contact your Clarivate account manager or [technical support](https://support.clarivate.com/) with questions regarding API access.

## Use Cases

### Match a set of DOIs or PMIDs to the Web of Science

With a CSV file with the following information, retrieve the Web of Science identifier (UT), DOI, current times cited count, and a link to the Web of Science.

Script name: [`lookup_ids.py`](./lookup_ids.py)

#### incoming data
|PMID|DOI|
|----|---|
19883697|10.1016/j.bbr.2009.10.030
22011016|10.1080/09602011.2011.621275
2223077|10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.12.011

#### matched data

|id|ut|doi|pmid|times cited|source|
|---|---|---|---|----|---|

### Match based on bibliometric data
The AMR API also allows you to retrieve articles based on bibliometric data, such as the article title and authors. Authors should be in a single field, separated by semicolons. Note that the data provided to the API must match a single article, if the result set is non-unique you will not receive any results. Please note, matching based on bibliometric data is not available for customers entitled only to the AMRLite service. An example csv file excluding bibliometric fields is included as ids_example_lite.csv.

### Get JCR URLs for a set of ISSNs

Script name: [`issns_to_jcr.py`](./issns_to_jcr.py)

An incoming csv file with a column with an ID and a ISSN can be match to the Web of Science and a link to the Journal Citation Reports URL for that journal can be returned.
~~~
$ python3 issns_to_jcr.py issns_example.csv outputfile.csv
~~~
